Title: "How to validate DCAT-AP-SE metadata with Python?"

I'm trying to validate my catalog against DCAT-AP-SE standards.
I have a JSON file with metadata, but I'm not sure if it meets
the obligatory fields requirement.

What I've tried:
- Checked the official spec

Does anyone have a Python script or tool recommendation?
